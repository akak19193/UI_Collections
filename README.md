## Breif Explanation
There are two tabs, one tab to show movies and another tab to show wallpapers. Click the movie to show more information and click wallpaper to open full screen dialog which supports gesture enlarge and action to store.

## APIs
Two web APIs are used in this app, namely TMDB (The movie database) and Abyss wallpaper. Their API keys are stored in strings.xml and removed before uploading.
